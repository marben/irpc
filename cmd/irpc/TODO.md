- merge hash from client and service to one var. it should be ok within a single package
- ? put file path within go module to generated file, to allow two identical interfaces register two different service implementation from different packages but on the same endpoint
- two interfaces in one file - are service/client hashes the same? maybe we need to add interface name to the hash?
- get rid of "var zero" declarations for some cases, where we know the zero value (nil for inerface/slice/map, "" for string etc...)
- map[int]interface{}
- dot imports
- BinaryAppender
- test named types outside of module
- support/test aliases
- get rid of .codeblock() in encoders, since almost none use it - we can make a separate interface for it
- (maybe) implement bitpacking writer. first for slice of bool, eventually perhaps
    for everything? (could use some benchmarking before that though)
- implement and test sending big messages with different endpoint.MaxMsgLen. client should be splitting msgs etc?
