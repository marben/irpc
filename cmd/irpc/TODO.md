- document versioning in README
- map[int]interface{}
- think about and probably implement nil-ability of slices, maps, etc...
 - perhaps use generics for slices/maps etc? it would simplify generated code greatly
- make sure passing interface{} != nil returns something that is not nil ??
- interface{} like for instance in map[int]interface{} doesn't need to have a codeblock
- support files outside of module. it is currently unsupported and fails
- two interfaces in one file - are service/client hashes the same? maybe we need to add interface name to the hash?
- get rid of "var zero" declarations for some cases, where we know the zero value (nil for inerface/slice/map, "" for string etc...)
- dot imports
- BinaryAppender
- test named types outside of module
- support/test aliases
- (maybe) implement bitpacking writer. first for slice of bool, eventually perhaps
    for everything? (could use some benchmarking before that though)
- implement and test sending big messages with different endpoint.MaxMsgLen. client should be splitting msgs etc?
