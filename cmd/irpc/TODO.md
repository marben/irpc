- two interfaces in one file - are service/client hashes the same? maybe we need to add interface name to the hash?
- map[int]interface{}
- dot imports
- does encoder still make sense? there seems to be only one now - directcallencoder, no?
 - actually i think direct call encoder should be merged into direct call type. not sure about lenEncoder and boolEncoder, but those are just 2
- BinaryAppender
- test named types outside of module
- support/test aliases
- get rid of .codeblock() in encoders, since almost none use it - we can make a separate interface for it
- (maybe) implement bitpacking writer. first for slice of bool, eventually perhaps
    for everything? (could use some benchmarking before that though)
- implement and test sending big messages with different endpoint.MaxMsgLen. client should be splitting msgs etc?
