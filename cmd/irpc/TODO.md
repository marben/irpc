- make generators report their imports and only populate qualifier from param structs, not gen functions - if possible?
- write a function to to batch serialiaton/deserialization/error reporting and call it from generated code instead of the repetitive error checking
- document versioning in README
- map[int]interface{}
- not sure about interfaces with multiple return values in function
    - try something like return value of type error2 interface{Error() (string,int)}
- test []time.Time  -- test new slice implementation and asymetrical encoder
- formatting with stdlib produces different (imho worse) than gofmt.
    - i am not sure why, but it seems to be a common thing. esapecially with nested func definitions like with struct encoding
    - is there a fix?
- think about and probably implement nil-ability of slices, maps, etc...
 - perhaps use generics for slices/maps etc? it would simplify generated code greatly
- make sure passing interface{} != nil returns something that is not nil ??
- looking at test struct_irpc.go vect3x3 serialization, there is a lot of repetitive code
    - perhaps we could attach named serialization functions for sub-structures? in this case vect3
- fuzzy test of Enc/Dec functions to make sure, encodings match
- interface{} like for instance in map[int]interface{} doesn't need to have a codeblock
- support files outside of module. it is currently unsupported and fails
- two interfaces in one file - are service/client hashes the same? maybe we need to add interface name to the hash?
- get rid of "var zero" declarations for some cases, where we know the zero value (nil for inerface/slice/map, "" for string etc...)
- dot imports
- BinaryAppender
- test named types outside of module
- support/test aliases
- (maybe) implement bitpacking writer. first for slice of bool, eventually perhaps
    for everything? (could use some benchmarking before that though)
- implement and test sending big messages with different endpoint.MaxMsgLen. client should be splitting msgs etc?
- consider encoding isNil for binaryMarshaller that is pointer type. this could probably be done with generics, making 2 functions. 1 for solid types, 1 for pointer types
