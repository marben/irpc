# IRPC over TCP Example

This example demonstrates using [irpc](https://github.com/marben/irpc) to create RPC services over TCP connections.

## Overview

The example defines a `Backend` interface with string utility methods like `ReverseString`, `RepeatString`, and `TimeToString`. The irpc code generator automatically creates the RPC client and server implementations from this interface.

## Running the Example

Start the server in one terminal:
```bash
go run ./cmd/server
```

Run the client in another terminal:
```bash
go run ./cmd/client
```

The client will connect to the server on localhost:8080 and make RPC calls, demonstrating string operations and latency measurements.

## Code Generation

The RPC code in `backend_irpc.go` is generated by running `go generate` on `backend.go`. This creates the necessary serialization, client proxy, and server adapter code automatically.
